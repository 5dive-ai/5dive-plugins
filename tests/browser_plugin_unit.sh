# DIVE-4021 — `5dive browser`: profile-per-site auth and a deterministic executor.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS ARRANGED AROUND. The row names three structural gaps, and a
# test that only proved "the happy path prints something" would grade none of
# them. So every arm below is a MUTANT of the specific defect the design exists
# to prevent, driven through the real bin/browser as a subprocess:
#
#   gap 1 sessions die   -> T4x: a cold profile FAILS CLOSED. The mutant is an
#                           executor that finds out mid-publish and improvises.
#   gap 2 verification   -> T5x: exit status follows the OUT-OF-BAND re-read and
#                           NOT the driver. Two mutants, and the second is the
#                           dangerous one: driver-red + artifact-live must exit 0,
#                           because a "failure" there is what double-posts on retry.
#   gap 3 profiles ARE   -> T2x: a directory this seat does not own, or that is
#         credentials       group-readable, is refused rather than repaired.
#
# There is no chrome on a CI runner and this suite must not need one, so the
# probe is driven by putting a FAKE `google-chrome` first on PATH. That is not a
# test hook in the product — bin/browser has no probe override to set, and could
# not, because a way to declare a profile live without looking is the one backdoor
# this design cannot afford. The fake is exercising the real _probe.
