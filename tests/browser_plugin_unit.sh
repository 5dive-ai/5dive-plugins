# DIVE-4021 — `5dive browser`: profile-per-site auth and a deterministic executor.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE IS ARRANGED AROUND. The row names three structural gaps, and a
# test that only proved "the happy path prints something" would grade none of
# them. So every arm below is a MUTANT of the specific defect the design exists
# to prevent, driven through the real bin/browser as a subprocess:
#
#   gap 1 sessions die   -> T4x: a cold profile FAILS CLOSED. The mutant is an
#                           executor that finds out mid-publish and improvises.
#   gap 2 verification   -> T5x: exit status follows the OUT-OF-BAND re-read and
#                           NOT the driver. Two mutants, and the second is the
#                           dangerous one: driver-red + artifact-live must exit 0,
#                           because a "failure" there is what double-posts on retry.
#   gap 3 profiles ARE   -> T2x: a directory this seat does not own, or that is
#         credentials       group-readable, is refused rather than repaired.
#
# There is no chrome on a CI runner and this suite must not need one, so the
# probe is driven by putting a FAKE `google-chrome` first on PATH. That is not a
# test hook in the product — bin/browser has no probe override to set, and could
# not, because a way to declare a profile live without looking is the one backdoor
# this design cannot afford. The fake is exercising the real _probe.

# ================================== T10 server mode + the one-time viewer (DIVE-4118)
#
# The viewer is a live keyboard on a logged-in profile, so every arm here is a
# MUTANT of a way that keyboard gets handed to the wrong person:
#
#   T10b  the ticket file keeps the raw nonce  -> a stolen box is a stolen session
#   T10e  a leaked URL is replayable           -> a TTL alone never closes this
#   T10f  the URL works past its expiry
#   T10g  the URL works in a DIFFERENT session -> pasted-link theft
#   T10h  the nonce is accepted from argv      -> /proc/<pid>/cmdline is not a vault
#   T10i  a wrong nonce is accepted
#   T10j  revoke leaves the ticket redeemable
#   T10c  a box missing the packages half-starts instead of saying so
#   T10k  a viewer is minted with no session binding at all
#   T10m  x11vnc/websockify/Xvfb are started with a flag that opens the box
#   T10n  the VNC server dies before the ticket it was minted for expires
#   T10o  a spent ticket still tells an attacker whether a nonce was right
#   T10p  a ticket outlives the browser it views, and redeems onto a dead port
#   T10q  a REPLAY kills the live viewer -> a hoisted refusal that is not pure
#   T10r  a missing VNC credential SPENDS the customer's one-time link
#   T10s  a link is issued onto a bridge that has not bound its port yet
#   T10t  the ticket advertises life the VNC server was never given
#
# There is no X server on a CI runner, so Xvfb/x11vnc/websockify are FAKES on
# PATH. They are not product hooks: liveness is still the real PID check in
# _serve_running, and redemption is the real sha256 compare. The only override is
# the X socket DIRECTORY, which is a path — pointing it somewhere else cannot make
# a dead display read as live.
#
# AND THE FAKES RECORD THEIR ARGV. The first version of them ran `exec sleep 300`
# and threw "$@" away, which quietly deleted a whole test surface: the property
# this design LEADS with — nothing listens off-box — lives entirely in the flags
# we pass these three programs, so with argv discarded, dropping -localhost, or
# binding websockify to 0.0.0.0, or dropping -nolisten tcp changed nothing any arm
# could see (measured: 125/0 for each). A fake that ignores argv cannot grade a
# flag. These write "$*" to a file the T10m arms below assert on, so the flags are
# MEASURED here and not merely unverified against the real programs.
